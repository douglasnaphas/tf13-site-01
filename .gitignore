# Ignore any .tfvars files that are generated automatically for each Terraform run. Most
# .tfvars files are managed as part of configuration and so should be included in
# version control.

# example.tfvars

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
#
# !example_override.tf

# Include tfplan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
# example: *tfplan*

# When using remote state with Terraform Cloud, we can't specify an input
# variable on the command line with -var='varname=varval'. Setting the variable
# with TV_VAR_varname=varval doesn't seem to work with remote state, either.
# Use LOCAL.auto.tfvars to set variables that are required but that will be
# passed in as Terraform variables in Terraform Cloud. LOCAL.auto.tfvars has
# a lexically early name, so that its values will be overridden by any values
# set in, for example, a directory's file called prod.auto.tfvars.
